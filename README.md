# Stacking-Ensemble-MPM
Source codes for a multistage stacking ensemble framework for porphyry copper prospectivity mapping. SVR and ANN-MLP models were implemented in Python, while GPR and Logistic Regression were implemented in R.The scripts expect a tabular dataset containing geological, geochemical, geophysical, and remote sensing predictors.
Due to data confidentiality, the original datasets are not included in this repository.

## Methodology Overview

This study proposes a multistage stacking ensemble framework for mineral prospectivity mapping.  
Base learners are first trained independently, and their outputs are then integrated into a meta-learning layer.

### Base Learners
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN-MLP)
- Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)

### Meta-Learner
- Logistic Regression with Elastic Net regularization

The final prospectivity map is generated by combining base model predictions with original exploration features.
