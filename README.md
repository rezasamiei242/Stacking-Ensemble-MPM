# Stacking-Ensemble-MPM
Source codes for a multistage stacking ensemble framework for porphyry copper prospectivity mapping. SVR and ANN-MLP models were implemented in Python, while GPR and Logistic Regression were implemented in R.The scripts expect a tabular dataset containing geological, geochemical, geophysical, and remote sensing predictors.
Due to data confidentiality, the original datasets are not included in this repository.
